//
// This builds the skeleton: packs the prepared pieces into one atlas page and
// emits a Spine 4.1 JSON with a bone per joint and the existing animations.
//
// WHY A RIG AND NOT A STILL
//
// Certification called out poor animation. A painted character standing perfectly
// still beside a board that is moving is worse than no character — it reads as a
// background print rather than as part of the game. The pieces were supplied
// split precisely so it can move, so it moves.
//
// COORDINATES
//
// A rotate keyframe's field is `value`, NOT `angle`. `angle` is the Spine 3.8
// spelling; 4.x renamed it, and the 4.2 runtime does not fall back - it reads no
// rotation at all and plays the animation with every bone left in setup pose. It
// throws nothing and logs nothing. The file loads, the character stands there.
//
// The other timelines were already right: translate and scale are {time, x, y}
// in both versions, which is why the hip and torso moved and only the limbs
// looked frozen.
//
// The cutout is 573x860 with y increasing DOWNWARD from the top-left. Spine has y
// increasing UPWARD from the skeleton origin, which is placed between the feet
// (ROOT below) so the character can be positioned by its ground contact rather
// than by the corner of a canvas.
//
// The joints below follow the visible seams of the new character. Bones are all
// unrotated in setup pose, so each attachment is simply its piece's centre
// relative to its bone, and an animation rotating a bone pivots the art about the
// real joint.

// ── animations ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// idle is the one that plays for hours, so it is deliberately understated: the
// job is to look alive between spins, not to draw the eye off the reels. Nothing
// in it is on the same period as anything else, so the loop never lands on an
// obvious beat — a mascot whose parts all breathe together reads as one object
// pulsing, which is the tell that it is a rig rather than a body.
//
// The legs do not move. They are planted, they carry the weight, and animating
// them is how a standing character starts to look like it is treading water.
// -- how this character is allowed to move --------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHAT THIS ART WILL AND WILL NOT DO
//
// The first version of this set rotated the shoulders up to 142 degrees to put
// both fists over the head, and folded the elbows 99 to put them on the chest.
// The maths was right, the poses were reachable, and in the game they looked
// broken. Watching a capture back frame by frame says exactly why, and it is a
// property of the DRAWING rather than of the rig:
//
//   · Each arm is one continuous mass of fur, painted hanging, and tapering from
//     a wide shoulder down to a narrow wrist. Swing it 90 degrees and the wide
//     end is at the top of a horizontal bar - the taper now runs the wrong way,
//     and it reads as a plank being rotated rather than as an arm being raised.
//
//   · The forearm and hand pieces are centred well BELOW their own joints (the
//     hand piece is 129x259 - it is most of a forearm, not a fist). Fold the
//     elbow far and that whole mass doubles back alongside the upper arm, so the
//     two overlap into one blob with no readable elbow. On the capture the arm
//     simply appears to bend backwards.
//
//   · A cutout rig has no depth. There is no way to pass a limb in front of the
//     torso and have it read as being in front.
//
// None of that is fixable in keyframes. It is fixable in the ANGLES, so every
// animation below stays inside a budget the drawing can carry, and the character
// comes from the body instead:
// These are MEASURED, by posing the shoulder at 0/10/20/.../80 degrees and
// looking at each one (design/preview_monkey_spine.mjs against a temporary
// linear sweep). The drawing holds to about 25, is stiff but passable at 30, and
// from 40 the arm has visibly left the vest - there is a gap at the shoulder and
// the fur taper has started to run the wrong way. By 50 it is a plank.
//
// 46 was the second guess and it was still over the line. Guessing is what put
// 142 in here the first time.
const MAX_SHOULDER = 26;
const MAX_ELBOW = 22;
//
// A HANGING FOREARM STAYS PLUMB
//
// The rest pose already has a bend at each elbow - the left upper arm points at
// 262 degrees and its forearm at 280, the right at 283 and 273. That bend is
// what makes the arm read as an arm.
//
// Rotating the forearm the SAME way as the shoulder cancels it. Swing the left
// shoulder -26 and the forearm inherits it (280 - 26 = 254); add another -22 and
// the forearm sits at 232 against an upper arm at 236 - four degrees apart, i.e.
// a straight line. That is exactly the plank the shoulder budget exists to
// avoid, arrived at from the other end, and it is what "the left arm going up
// looks wrong" was.
//
// A relaxed arm does the opposite: the shoulder swings and the forearm stays
// roughly plumb, because it is hanging. So for any swing that is not an active
// push, the elbow counter-rotates at about seventy percent of the shoulder.
const hang = (shoulder) => -Math.round(shoulder * 0.7);
//
// Two deliberate exceptions, both of them arms being DRIVEN rather than hanging:
// chestbeat flexes the elbow inward to carry the fist across the body, and
// throwit extends the whole limb into the throw. Those keep the same sign as the
// shoulder on purpose.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS, SAID PLAINLY
//
// 26 degrees is not a raised arm and it is nowhere near a fist over the head.
// The arms-in-the-air celebration is not available from this artwork, and no
// amount of keyframing gets it back - it needs the upper arm redrawn as its own
// piece with a shoulder that reads when rotated, which is an art change.
//
// So every animation here is carried by the BODY: the hip, the torso's squash
// and stretch, the head, and the timing between them. The arms only trail. That
// is a real constraint honestly worked within, not a compromise hidden in the
// middle of a file.
//
// Directions, measured from the rig rather than assumed: shoulder-to-elbow rests
// at 262 degrees on the left and 283 on the right, so "outward and up" is
// negative on the left and positive on the right.

//
// THIS IS WHERE THE JERK CAME FROM, NOT THE KEYFRAME VALUES
//
// A Spine keyframe with no `curve` is LINEAR. Every timeline written above had
// none, so each key was a corner: the velocity changed instantly at every one of
// them. With keys 0.2s apart - a pump, a strike, a nod - that is a visible jolt
// several times a second, which is exactly the "shaking" in the capture. No
// amount of adjusting the angles fixes it, because the angles were never the
// problem.
//
// Every timeline is therefore run through a Catmull-Rom pass that gives each key
// a tangent taken from its NEIGHBOURS, so the curve carries its momentum through
// the key instead of stopping dead and setting off again.
//
// Not plain ease-in-out on every segment, which is the obvious thing and is
// wrong here: that forces the velocity to zero at every key, so a run of close
// keys turns into a series of little stops - smooth in each segment and lurching
// across the sequence.
//
// Tangents are clamped the Fritsch-Carlson way (monotone cubic). Unclamped
// Catmull-Rom overshoots between keys, and an overshoot on a shoulder would push
// it past MAX_SHOULDER - the one budget this whole set is built around - in
// frames that never appear in any keyframe.
//
// Format: `curve` holds four numbers per animated property (rotate has one,
// translate and scale have two), and they are ABSOLUTE (time, value) control
// points, not normalised fractions. See SkeletonJson.readCurve.
// `loopD` closes the curve on itself. Without it the first and last keys get
// one-sided tangents, so a looping animation arrives at its end moving and
// restarts from a standstill - a small hitch, once per loop, forever. idle runs
// for the whole session, so once per 5.4s is thousands of times a sitting.
//
// It only means anything when the timeline starts and ends on the same value and
// its last key IS the loop point, which is why every idle timeline below is
// written to close at exactly the animation's duration.
