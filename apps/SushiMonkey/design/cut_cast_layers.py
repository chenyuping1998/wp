"""Cut a single full-body cast drawing into the rig's layers.

    python3 design/cut_cast_layers.py mg|fg

Sushi Monkey's two cast figures were delivered as ONE flat image each
(design/cast_delivery/<cast>_full_source.png, 983x1600), not as the layered
PSD the Boomana rig was built from. This does what extract_monkey_psd.py does
for a PSD, from polygons instead of layers:

  1. scale the drawing onto the rig's 560x912 canvas (the same aspect, so the
     body lands roughly where Boomana's did and the inherited animations fit)
  2. PARTITION every opaque pixel into exactly one piece by polygon (first
     match wins, in CUTS order); whatever no polygon claims is the trunk
  3. UNDERLAY: a piece drawn BELOW a neighbour is extended UNDER that
     neighbour by up to UNDERLAY px, painted with its own nearest colour, so
     when a limb rotates it uncovers more of the same cloth rather than a hole.
     (The sleeve covers the top of the forearm, the calf covers the bottom of
     the thigh, the trunk covers everything it hangs from.)
  4. write design/source/<cast>/<piece>.png trimmed to its alpha, layers.json
     (canvas + each piece's box and z) and _compare.png (source | rebuild) —
     check the compare first: it proves nothing was dropped.

Layer names follow the Boomana PSD's convention because generate_monkey_spine
resolves bones by those prefixes (torso_*, head_*, left_arm_0/2, left_leg_0/1/2…).
