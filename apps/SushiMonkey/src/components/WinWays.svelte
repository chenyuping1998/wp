	// WHY THIS IS NOT A LINE PRESENTATION
	//
	// Gen-1 and gen-2 drew a coloured polyline per payline and ran a grenade along
	// it. A ways game has no line to run along: a symbol pays wherever it lands on
	// its reel, and a single win can involve eight scattered cells with no path
	// between them. Drawing one would invent a shape the maths does not have.
	//
	// So this follows what ways games actually do — Megaways, Nolimit, Pragmatic
	// all present the same way, and players arrive already knowing how to read it:
	//
	//   1. the board dims
	//   2. the winning cells stay bright, with a frame around each
	//   3. a badge states how many WAYS paid
	//
	// The dimming is drawn as rectangles over the NON-winning cells rather than as
	// a scrim with holes cut in it. A 4x5 board is 20 cells, so the rect list is
	// trivial, and it avoids pixi v8's mask/hole API entirely — inverse masks are
	// the kind of thing that works until a version bump.

	// A symbol's win spine runs ~1.4s. The reveal itself is far shorter, so
