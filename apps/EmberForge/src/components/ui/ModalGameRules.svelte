				<p>
					Ember Forge is a {reelCount}&times;{rowCount} {T.clusterPays} slot. There are no {T.paylines}:
					any 5 or more matching symbols that touch horizontally or vertically form a cluster and
					{T.pay}, wherever they sit on the board. Winning symbols are then removed, the symbols above
					them fall down and new ones drop in from the top &mdash; if that forms another cluster it
					{T.pays} too, and the chain continues until no cluster forms. Every cluster in a chain is
					added together. The theoretical return to player (RTP) is {rtpPct}.
				</p>

					The Forge Hammer Wild substitutes for every symbol except the Scatter, letting it join clusters

				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="wp-card">
				<h3><span class="wp-accent-bar"></span>Scatter</h3>
				<p>
					The Forge Scatter can land anywhere on the board. It does not {T.pay} on its own and
					does not need to be part of a cluster &mdash; its only job is to open the feature. Landing
					4, 5, 6 or 7 Scatters in a single spin awards {scatterSpins} Free Spins respectively.
					Three Scatters is not enough to start the feature.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="wp-card">
				<h3><span class="wp-accent-bar"></span>Free Spins &amp; the heat grid</h3>
				<p>
					Free Spins are played on the same board, but every position now keeps a multiplier. All
					positions start cold and count as 1&times;. The first time a position is part of a winning
					cluster it is heated to 1&times;, and every further win on that position raises it by
					+1&times;. A cluster is {T.paid} by its symbol value multiplied by the total heat of every
					position it covers, so clusters landing on well-worked areas of the board {T.pay} far more.
					The grid keeps its heat for the whole feature and is reset when the feature ends.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="wp-card">
				<h3><span class="wp-accent-bar"></span>Retriggers</h3>
				<p>
					Landing 3 or more Scatters during Free Spins retriggers the feature and awards
					{retriggerSpins} additional spins. The heat grid is <strong>not</strong> reset by a
					retrigger &mdash; it carries on building. This applies to Free Spins entered by landing
					Scatters and to Free Spins {T.bought} from the {T.betMenu}.

						Instead of waiting for Scatters, you can {T.buy} direct entry into the Free Spins

						&mdash; they differ only in how much the result varies from one entry to the next.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>{buyCost}&times; your {T.totalBet}</strong> &mdash; enters on 4 or 5 Scatters,
							for 10 or 12 Free Spins. Maximum win {buyMaxWin.toLocaleString()}&times;.

						{#if steadyCost}
							<li>
								<strong>{steadyCost}&times; your {T.totalBet} (Steady)</strong> &mdash; enters on 5
								or 6 Scatters, for 12 or 15 Free Spins, and its maximum win is capped at
								{steadyMaxWin.toLocaleString()}&times; rather than {buyMaxWin.toLocaleString()}&times;.
								That lower ceiling is the point: it is what lets the typical result sit much
								closer to what was played. It does <strong>not</strong> {T.pay} more overall.
